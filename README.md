### 🎯 Architecture Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
- **Testability**: Easy to test each layer in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Changes are isolated to specific layers
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic is centralized in the domain layer
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
